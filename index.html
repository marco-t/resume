    <h2 class="category-headers">Summary</h2><hr>
      <p class="category-description-main">I am a Developer seeking a position as a Junior Web Developer. I have experience working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS as well as testing tools such as RSpec and Capybara.</p>

      <p class="category-description-main">I believe in writing clear and concise code that is easily maintained and well tested. I’m a proponent of BDD and designing simple software that only does what the user needs it to do. “Wouldn’t it be cool if…” features should remain a fantasy if they do not obviously enhance the user’s experience or productivity.</p>

      <p class="category-description-main">Some of my personal development projects include a fundraising website for a non-profit, a link aggregator and an events calendar for professionals seeking continuing education.</p>

    <h2 class="category-headers">Deployed Websites</h2><hr>
